This folder structure contains the Dockerfiles for building RabbitMQ clusters with high availability and haproxy instance running on top of them - the number of nodes are completely customizable using https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose] docker-compose.yml file.

Running the Cluster:
--------------------
Once the images are built, boot up the cluster using the docker-compose.yml configuration provided in cluster folder:

[source]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

If the entire cluster comes up, the management console can be accessed at http://<dockerip>:15670

Connections to the rabbitmq server should be made through haproxy instace, that is `<dockerip>:5670`

You can view stats page of haproxy using: http://<dockerip>:8100/stats

Structure:
==========
There are 3 folders.

1. base - this is the base Dockerfile which builds on a CentOS image and installs the RabbitMQ binaries on the image
2. server - This builds on the base image and has the startup script for bring up a RabbitMQ server
3. haproxy - This folder contains the Dockerfile that creats the haproxy image configured for master-slave setup
4. cluster - This contains a https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose] definition file(docker-compose.yml) for brining up the rabbitmq cluster. Use `docker-compose up -d` to bring up the cluster.

High availability achieved by using the configuration below in `startrabbit.sh` .This configuration will be mirroring
all the queues to the all nodes in the cluster.You can read more on highly available rabbitmq clustering  https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html[here].

[source]
----
rabbitmqctl set_policy ha-all "." '{"ha-mode":"all","ha-sync-mode":"automatic"}'
----

Docker compose structure:
-------------------------

By default 2 nodes and 1 haproxy container are started up this way:
Note: You can remove port mappings for rabbit nodes since they will be accessed
by haproxy instance.I opened them up to access from outside world to rabbit nodes.

rabbit1:

Haproxy Configuration:
----------------------

`haproxy:1.5` base image used. Haproxy configuration made in http://www.joshdevins.net/2010/04/16/rabbitmq-ha-testing-with-haproxy/[this] way.
Haproxy logging configuration done by using method described http://kvz.io/blog/2010/08/11/haproxy-logging/[here].


To-Do List:
-----------
 - Upgrate to haproxy 1.6
 - Use dynamic dns look-up described http://blog.haproxy.com/2015/11/17/haproxy-and-container-ip-changes-in-docker/[here]
